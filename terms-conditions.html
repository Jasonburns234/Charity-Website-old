          <p>
            6. METHODS OF PROCESSING: The Owner takes appropriate security
            measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification,
            or unauthorized destruction of the Data
          </p>
          <p>
            The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
            tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
            related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
            cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in
            charge, involved with the operation of this Website (administration,
            sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties
            (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers,
            hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed,
            if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of
            these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. LEGAL BASIS OF PROCESSING: The Owner may process Personal Data
            relating to Users if one of the following applies
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
              Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
              Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
              (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
              following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
              processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection
              law.
            </li>
            <li>
              provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
              with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
              which the Owner is subject.
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
              interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
              Owner.
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
              interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party
            </li>
            <li>
              In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
              legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
              whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
              contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
              a contract
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            8. PLACE: The Data is processed at the Owner’s operating offices and
            in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are
            located. Depending on the User’s location, data transfers may
            involve transferring the User’s Data to a country other than their
            own. To find out more about the place of processing of such
            transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details
            about the processing of Personal Data. Users are also entitled to
            learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside
            the European Union or to any international organization governed by
            public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as
            the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
            safeguard their Data. If any such transfer takes place, Users can
            find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
            inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact
            section.
          </p>
          <p>
            9. RETENTION TIME: Personal Data shall be processed and stored for
            as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
            contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
            contract has been fully performed
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
              interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfil such
              purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
              legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
              sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
              period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as
              long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
              be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
              required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
              upon order of an authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
              Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
              rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
              after expiration of the retention period.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            10. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING: The Data concerning the User is
