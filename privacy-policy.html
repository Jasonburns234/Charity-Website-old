            steps to ensure that We fully protect your rights and comply with
            Our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic

          </p>
          <h3>9 - Storing your data</h3>
          <p>
            We do not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary
            in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Some or
            all of your data may be stored outside of the UK or European
            Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states,
            plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). You are deemed to accept
            and agree to this by using Our Site and submitting information to
            Us. If We do store data outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable
            steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as
            it would be within the UK and under the GDPR.
          </p>
          <h3>10 - Do We Share Your Data?</h3>
          <p>
            In certain circumstances, We may be legally required to share
            certain data held by Us, which may include your personal data, for
            example, where We are involved in legal proceedings, where We are
            complying with legal obligations, a court order, or a governmental
            authority. We may sometimes contract with third parties to supply
            products and services to you on Our behalf. These may include
            payment processing, delivery of goods, search engine facilities,
            advertising, and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may
            require access to some or all of your data. Where any of your data
            is required for such a purpose, We will take all reasonable steps to
            ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in
            accordance with your rights, Our obligations, and the obligations of
            the third party under the law. We may compile statistics about the
            use of Our Site including data on traffic, usage patterns, user
            numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will be
            anonymised and will not include any personally identifying data, or
            any anonymised data that can be combined with other data and used to
            identify you. We may sometimes use third party data processors that
            are located outside of the UK or European Economic Area (“the EEA”)
            (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and
            Liechtenstein). Where We transfer any personal data outside the EEA,
            We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is
            treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and
            under the GDPR.

          <h3>11 -What Happens If Our Business Changes Hands?</h3>
          <p>We may, from time to time, expand or reduce Our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Our business. Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of Our business that is being transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use that data only for the same purposes for which it was originally collected by Us.</p>
        
        <h3>12 -How Can You Control Your Data?</h3>
          <p>When you submit personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict Our use of your data. In particular, We aim to give you strong controls on Our use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from Us). You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (“the TPS”), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (“the CTPS”), and the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications that you have consented to receiving.</p>

          <p>You have the right to ask for a copy of any of your personal data held by Us (where such data is held).

          <ul>
            <li>Strictly Necessary Cookies – These cookies are essential for the running of a website and its features. They allow proper website functionality and access to services such as your account, secure shopping and posting comments on a blog. Without them, a website cannot perform properly</li>
            <li>Performance Cookies – These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website. For example, which pages are visited most often, how people navigate around the site and if there are any error messages that appear. They don’t collect any information that identifies a user, only anonymised, aggregated information that is used to improve the way the website works and the customer journey.</li>
            <li>Functionality Cookies – These cookies allow a website to remember your preferences and choices you make, such as your preferred language, region and username.

            <li>Web Beacons – Web beacons are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage. They allow an organisation to see if a cookie has been activated, if a user has clicked through to links to adverts contained in emails.
